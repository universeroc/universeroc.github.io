[How companies can keep the innovation flowing](http://www.virgin.com/disruptors/how-companies-can-keep-the-innovation-flowing)

Nobody has a monopoly on ideas, you need to be continually innovating. To stay ahead of your competitors you need to be able to innovate faster than they can. You can’t own an area and stay there, you need to keep moving.

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome in outsiders</p>
<p>Take time out</p>
<p>Continually scan the horizon</p>
<p>Don’t act your age - keep thinking like a startup</p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Always imagine yourself as a challenger and someone who is pushing the rules rather than living within the rules.</strong>
