These days I've been visiting [cocoachina](http://cocoachina.com) for news about iOS development. And I found this essay about language learning. It's amazing as it has some same viewpoint as my another idea.

It's translated from [techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com) and by that time 2015-07-03 it has been downloaded 90000 times.

In my opinion, mobile phone has various type for people to get information form internet other than visual format on PC. Phone has microphone and speaker, by default, so you never need to connect them by extra work comparing to PC. Also phone nowadays has more sensors to get more inforamtion around, this passage I don't talk about more.

Almost 90 percent information we get is from our eyes. And other from our ears for most. Sound or voice could free your eyes.

I quite agree with Simigin that if you want to speak natively that you need listen real native speaker's voice and follow them. By the way you could also make friends, you could learn his mother language and you can teach him yours. That sounds great.

OK, until now I have been talking too much about Simigin and some about information. What's my idea?

I'd like to say that China is a great and amazing country. There are 56 nations, also there is difference between even one village to its neighbour in language accent.

If there's one app which could cover most native accent in China, from my standpoint, it's will be a great thing. It's good to tranditional culture and it has Chinese characteristic.

As I know some nations in China even have not writing, their's language only from elders and spoken by them. After they dead, these parts will be lost.

Until now, only I have this idea but do not have a clear architecture to design and to implement it. If you read this passage and have same feelings as me, please send me emails for communication. I want to make it.
