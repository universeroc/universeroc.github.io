As a programmer, I always used to talk to myself to be professional.
There's a general saying "To be an employer or employee", if you don't want to be managed by someone other, you should be good at managing yourself.

About half an hour ago, I talked with my little brother through internet about his study. To my surprise, he said that he could not even understand a word what the teacher said in the class of Data Structure. He continuously told me that it's the same feeling of learning English at the first time that you know each single word meaning but never the sentence nor the whole passage.
With these information, I asked him how to overcome the difficuties of English to get some hint. To remember them was his answer. "You could also try to remember these then to understand them." I said. "English is OK, but the Data Structure, how to?" "... ..."

He was too hurry to get a rapid progress, as a result, he could not stand that in the class when he could not figure out what the teacher taught he would feel panic. Practice makes perfect. If you could not do it well, it only proves that your work is not hard enough. Just try it again.

Then I asked him a simple question after he told me something about his C knowledge:
char str;
scanf("%c", &str);
As we know if we want get an input from user in C, use scanf will be OK. Question is scanf("%d", &str) could work well ?

He gave me a NO. "You should program it on your computer to find the answer."

He told me that he could not as he reinstall his OS and lost his programe envirement, however, he tried to download the evirement but they all be with virus. He could not install the envirement without his teacher!

Oh my god, I could not believe that one person who wants to be a coder even can not find the right tool on the internet in 21st. He told me the envirement was installed by his teacher, all his classmates too. Wordless!

Put all your love to your major as to your life.

At last I said to him "you are too unprofessional."
