As most developers know each platform has its particular interface. It brings to us too much pain to make our application cross-platform. It's also about web pages. But with HTML5 published, it becomes even better.

Nowadays in China, mobile application development is hot. And nearly all big company begins to publish its phone such as MEIZU, OPPO, Lenovo, etc. Even if they did not make phone before. Because of Android, each of them would like to try it.

I'm a C++ developer on Windows. Almost time I've been paied attention to cross-platform code, in other words, platform-independent. But if you use any native API e.g. graphics API, you will need write more code using #ifdef to compile differently on platforms. But web you know, it's a public standard.

<strong>Firefox is the leader.</strong>

From my standpoint, I believe that Firefox OS which developed based on the browser has a bright future. Comparing to Android, it's low reource comsumption and easily to develop as what you do to code a web page. You will not need to pay more attention to the cross-platform issue any more.

It's difficult for me to finish one application in one month but not too hard for a web developer. If you could, I suggest you to have a try. I'll keep my attention to Firefox OS.
