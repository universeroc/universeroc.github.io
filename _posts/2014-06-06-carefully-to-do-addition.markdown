Not long ago I got to know this game named "[Dots: Chain Reaction](http://a.mofang.com/pingce/102-51340-1.html)". It's a simple and easy game. And also a popular one.

I had been talked with my friends in spare time we could also try to make a game ourselves as I found that GAME was, is a very unique application software that almost everyone would like to use to play.

Several games such as Flappy Bird or 2048 or Don't tap the white tile are popular. They have some same features, for example, easy, simple, but worth to play using your brain. They don't have complicated logic or delicated image so people with any level could easily begin.

Ok, then I begin to think over what we're doing or planning to do. Firstly one feature, then another fuction or image, one by one.

<b>Addition is amazing.</b>

To somebody "add new feature" means creation. But what you should figure out is "new feature" means more work to do. And also you sould pay attention to it whether they make your design more complex.

Be careful to do addition.

Less is more. Make space for imagination and innovation.
