A female coder is reported on <a href='http://code.csdn.net/news/2822063'>CSDN</a> makes a deep impression on me. Recently I have been considering to build a blog to post anything I learn or think each day, her story make me feel shamed. However, I've been graduated about more than five years, but when I look back for anything valuable or knowledge, I'm been wordless as I don't manage or tidy my information daily so after a long time just feel busy and tired but could not describe what I'm busy with and why.

I post this essay to my group on QQ, and they all agree with it on accumulation. Experience and time is wealth. More haste, less speed.
Before you are exprienced, you should calm down to learn to exprience little things to grow up. Don't ignore the value of little success or failure. There's an old saying goes in China to describe someone who never remember the things they experience to avoid it next time "Bear break the cron, and throw it after getting a new one".It's a bad habit not to write notes.

It reminds me the procedure of learning English. Several months ago, we planned to study English to pass IELTS then to apply working visa in New zealand. Sorry to talk about this plan as it's aborted even if I bought the newest book from official IELTS and we communicated English study after work at home for about more than two months with less and less passion and the very affairs in daily life, finally, we don't talk about English or immigration any more. But the experience of oral English learning is worth to have. During that period, I used to surf online to find any materials related to oral English learning. I'd like to break the barrier of language to communicate freely with foriegners. Afer several weeks work, I came to conclusion that there's not a short way to make it, the key is practice more and keep it.
<blockquote>Practice makes perfect</blockquote>
Do you remember how you learn to speak Chinese? And how to learn new words or phrases? So you could figure out practice is the very thing.
This video is worth to see more than one times. Input and output to us coders is familiar. When you find the right way to do, the next is practice only.

Don't hurry.
With steady improvement day by day, you know you are on the right direction, your goal becomes more and more clear.
