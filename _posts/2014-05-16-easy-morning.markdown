I've been listening EasyMorning about one month at every morning on the way to work. Sometimes you feel a little tired even you have gotten a sleep but from the radio Xiaofei and Yuzhou always give you laughter. I'll bet if you have a good emotion in the morning, you will have a great start as an old saying goes "Morning is the key to all entire day".

This morning Xiaofei shared a healing essay which made Yuzhou laughing from the begin to the end. So did I. What a brilliant text I've ever heard. It's too long to share all of it to audiences. I'm going to share it to you if Xiaofei or Yuzhou reply me with the title or something about that essay.

What a sunny day today! After work this afternoon, I'll go to attend a friend's wedding. Best wishes to him. Hope that tomorrow will be as good as today.
