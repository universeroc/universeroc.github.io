This morning I read this article [Tempt looks like chance](https://www.huxiu.com/article/173050.html).

It's better to start ealier for long term task. Yes, I agree with this opinion. Anything could not be done in one day, it's all made of tiny pieces in enough long time as the procedure of Earth evolution.

Often get out of things you're busy with and rethink what's the target. Ordinary people are busy day after day, doing things repeatly, they don't think why they should do those things and what's meaning of the very thing. Only those who are thinking that could make different with others.

As we used to say 80/20 principle, about 20% time is meaningful, and the left time of day is meaningless. So busy is not and should not be the main tune of one day. You must think what's the most important think to do of the very day, and do it as early as you can, then the less important one, then others.

Write details notes down.

I had written daily note sice middle school until my college. It's been 10 years. But after my graduation, I gave up this habbit. It's a pity. Work, idea, life, and entertainment makes up everyday, but I don't log them and they become blur day by day. Several days ago, I looked for one document and found many words on paper which record the feelings or details of those days waked up the memory.

Early morning.

I kept getting up early for months, but failed to make it those days. I'm too sleepy to get up. :(

Right now I read Wangjianlin's One Day, he wakes up 4 in the morning, then do sports for 45 minitues. There's saying: it's fearful the talented person who is the diligent one. When you get up early, you have enough time to think to make your plan. It inspires me a lot which you are not sleepy, your body is not activated.

People always say time is not enough, so I don't do that, not finish these.

It's not the fault of time, it's your habbit, your management of time. When you get up early, and make your plan, clear your aim, you'll find more comfortable and more strengthful.

Sometimes I'm tired with current content of job, and think about something of my own, even do some daydream.

Tempt looks like chance. These words take a shot on me. Yes, almost all tempts look like chances. They are beauties, they are beatiful, attractive. To keep rational need your brain and experience. And I rethink those past ideas and so called chances are tempts.
