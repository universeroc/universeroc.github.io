After about one or two months, I will get into a low state. In these period, I don't want to code any more, even do not know what worth to do, blank in mind.

To me 2014 flies too quick to be aware that it's already September now.
I had some trouble in my job in last few weeks so that I wanted to get off the company. Since November 2011, I've been involved with Chromium project, until now I've been working around it for about three years. Chromium is a very good project coding with C++, it's even so called top-level project among open source projects.

Browser is so important on PC as the only main entrance to the internet.
Opera, 360, Sogou, MyIE, TheWorld, even UC PC version, almost developed based on Chromium.
Altough nowadays mobile internet developed so well, an app could get thounds of millions users, PC will always be the important tool for professional work.

Thanks to my choice of learning software, I came into this industry, and growed up with it.
5 years after graduated from university, now I came across a cross-road again.

What's your dream?
What do you want?

Even yesterday I watched a video one said "I don't think you open source our code is fine, I'm worried about other companies could use our code to compete with us...". The other one dropped the glass of wine to the wall and said "Would you like to make another company employing other programmers to work like before?"

Yes! If so you should be employed by someone not make a same one.

To me PC is familiar and browser too, but I could not hold all things.
Mobile development, by myself, I could do it well with my thinking. But I'm not familiar.

The day before yesterday, I went to rendacoder.com again to look for some part-time job, it's been bought by freelancer.com. I did the register again. After I chose all I'm familiar programming languages and tools, I got a list.
It's the fist time I looked for a part-time job on internet, I'm a little nervous and unconfident.
Twenties minutes later, I gave up.

Deep in my heart, I ask myself this question: what you could do ?!

It's a hard question to answer even I've been working or coding 5 years already.
I could code with C/C++, Python, ASP.NET, C#, SQL, Object C but I've been nervous when I view the freelancer.com.

It's not bad to be aware that you're not good enough.

If I get off this job, I'd like to start a company or to be freelancer.
It's a new challenge and interesting.
