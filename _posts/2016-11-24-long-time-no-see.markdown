It's been 6 months since last post. :(

To have a habbit, it needs two month time to last. Yeah, ok, my first post is 2014. From this point, I've made this habbit to write something.

What I'm busy with is I've been thinking whether I should leave Beijing, back to my hometown: Shijiazhuang, or stay here for about another two years? And I know if I went back, maybe I'll never go outside world again and to be far away with lately news especially internet. But the life is tough, especially facing with the higher price of house, it does not matter when you could rent one good house for a long time with a well price. It's hard to get one, so I just think over about these years after I graduacted, I've been changing house almost one time a year. And the price is the same 1/3 of my salary. :(

I don't want to quit this game in this way.

Life can't go backwards, what you do must be your favorite. Since you don't have extra chance to live your again. Do what other people do is a low dangerous thing, it's so called comfortable-area. Everyone wants to live in it, but if you want to get more, you should go out of it. You'll get more pressure and nervous but you grow.

What I remember is the scene in 2009 that before I graduaced from college, I saw people catching bus everyday in the morning, and I said to myself they were like a cog and repeated itself in the same cycle. Since I joined Tencent, I became one of them. And now is.

Reality beats the ideal.

God's laughing once people's thinking. You are what you think.

I'll keep writing as I must calm down to think.
