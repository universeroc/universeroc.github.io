I'm sure that I'm not clever, smart man.


What I stick to is make it simple. Mathematics is famous for its simple and elegant. For example 1 + 1 = 2. It's the foundation of all human beings' civilization. It's so simple but so powerful.


At one time, I could only think about one thing only not like my wife could deal with more than two things. So I keep to make life and work simple so I could live it. Ever I wrote an essay <b>Careful to Do Addition</b> also express my worry. With time going, things would become more and more complex with your addition. If you know it, you must pay more attention to it or it will be out of control.


I'm reading a passage about How to design an elegant mobile game. I'm a coder with active idea about design and product all the time, and it's a great article to me. Elegant is a perfect word to describe a new, great product you're making or going to make. To be elegant, firstly in my opinion, it's to be simple. Your product could be complex, but never looks complex. Especially to the mobile product, as mobile has limit screen size to show all things like PC and users' habbit and scene are not the same as PC that they are fragments. If you design a complex one, most will not have enough patience to learn how to use it and close it then uninstall it.


Keep everything you could simple and elegant is a discipline. Nowadays I'm also studying how to use framework to design as sometimes others could not figure out your mind. The efficient way is to do it by yourself. Here will be my experiment lab.
