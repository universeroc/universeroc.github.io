Today is monday, 12 May 2014. Another regular day to everyone.
After lunch we have about two hours to have a rest, recently I pick up english study again but the moment I don't have any passion to continue <<Friends>> season 1 which I watched only one episode last week.

From laoluo experience, passion is not a thing that could last long time only about two or three days. To keep it, once or twice a week to listen a speech or present with passion.

<strong>I do agree with him.</strong>

I was lucky to know laoluo and his experince. He's a talented speaker and also has great perseverance. He always told everybody he's a idealist. I could figure out an awful lot from his speech.

The moment what I should do? Have a break? Play a game? I don't want either. I viewed my bookmarks one by one until I found the very one with title "In future we trust--Kai Fu Lee".

His speech contains interests and passion that he told to the students of Peking university. It's also valuable to anybody I think.

Cuijin(Peking university)
Graduated from Peking with major of International relation,  she wanted to experience in a startup. Baidu is a small startup that time which she applied to, and only a receptionlist for her. And she got it to my surprise. I think if I was her maybe I will not. Put yourself low. Some years later, she joined Google, then she joined Innovation Works to start "wandoujia" as COO. Thanks to her experience.

Xuzhaohui(Tsinghua university)
He went to school and got to know he could not use computer as everyonce else. So he tried to learn but he was too poor to buy a computer. He made a keyboard using paper and practised typing on it. ChinaRen, Xiaonei, then diandian in Innovation Works. He's successful and also low.

Information industry has a rapid pace. In it everybody becomes impetuous easily. Follow your heart and remember what's you want. Kai-Fu Lee told us Job's motto "Stay hungry stay foolish".

When you trapped in some problem, thinking about death will help you out. Death is fair to anybody.
It reminds me that death is the port of life mama said to Forrest in <<Forrest Gump>> I watched yesterday.

Time is life. Follow your heart and seek what you're insterested at.

What's my interests?
Coding, book, film, famous speech, sports and travelling.

And now what's my point?
Coding and english.
