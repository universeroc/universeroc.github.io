What's well known is that knowledge is important. Since primary school those mottos on wall of famous person told us that knowledge is engery or so. Education is one of most important problem to the world we live in, especially to those who can't afford the cost of college, or those who even never have the rights to learn, to know the outside world because of the geographical issue.

All of us go to school and there are teachers who are experienced at those majors, one generation after another, if you're eagerly entering into high level school and learning by famous teachers, the only way to make it is the examinations, the key to the door.

During classic world, everything goes step by step, but it's changing when internet coming. Information explosion. Almost information spreads on the internet, and people has been online almost all day long after smart phone had been so convenient, so friendly. People won't buy newspaper or even read books, just read the news online, books online, commnicate online, even make friends online. It's so cheap and so convenient, only one computer or cellphone and internet, yeah, you can do what you can. And the spead of information exchange has overtake all times past.

There are more and more people who didn't go to high school find good job as they have the skills of internet or computer. That's the reason why I chose the major when I entered the university. I knew the computer is the future, it'll play a very important role in the world.

Ok, back to the issue. Khan Academy made a free online course for all people who wants to learn. He's good at math and works in finance. And his niece asked his some problems of math online, he used a wacom and chat software and telephone to solve her problems. He tried his best to make it simple and understandable to let her get it. After other childeren of relatives asked him for help of those hard problems. So he made those solutions Youtube video online. He found that so many people visited his videos and commented for thanks. It's out of expectation. There were 3 hours to go after work to make these videos, and he began to make more videos including science and computer. 5 years after, 2009, he quit his job, and full-time to do this.

Khan gives up his gooood job and create free course online, it's meaningful and helpful to all over the world. You can learn online and watch it again and again. Interest is the key. But so many teachers and parents who don't know even realize it, they only want theirs's childeren or students to make higher score or be more disciplined. When they find the interesting points, you never worry about the behavior.

To make lessons interesting is the ability of great teachers, not all teachers are qualified to make it.

Don't let your child grow so quickly, let he/she do what he/she should do at the right age. Interest is the best teacher.

Thank you Khan.
