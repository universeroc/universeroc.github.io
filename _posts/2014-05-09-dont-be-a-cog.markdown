Last weekend I went to alexdong.com again and found this essay.

Forgive me alex I've never asked you to allow me to copy your passage here.

It reminds me a lot. Too many memories fill my brain. It's so similiar to me as what I was used to grap when I was a student.
After classes, I'd like to read extra passages from newspapers or books and found many quotes and sayings which motivated me.

Even when I was a little boy, I spoke to myself that you were different to common people.

Until nowadays I confirm it. While other teenagers playing games or picking out girls, what I was doing?
Staying in library to read books to think to feel where is my direction what I love to do in the future.

I began to think what I'd like to do after graduated at the second year in my college. I planned to get through the master 
exam to get a better education. So I had been preparing with major knowledge and mathimatics. In my mind, the two subjects are the
most important even if you didn't try this exam. To english, I kept my habbit of speaking loud in the play ground in the morning
before class.

I have a particular emotion of english.

Passing CET4 and CET6 with one time each is not your achievement that I knew it clearly. It's coincided that Neusoft went to our
college to hunter. Dramatically I grasped this chance to enter Neusoft Beijing part. And it lasted not too long that we found we
could not do developing Symbian application, instead, testing. We failed to accept this change, and quited one by one.

I found another job again without too much time. It placed at Mudanyuan subwany around. It's clear even now that time I brought 
the GRE writing related book at work.

In my plan, I got through the master exam meanwhile I studied, trying to collect money for my abroad dream. I wanted to go to America
as IT in USA is the most developed. And also you could feel what another different culture and country is. It opens your eyes and mind.

They're all in 2009. How time flies!

5 years after graduated from college. Generally speaking, we all have a baisc state and direction. What you could do and what not.

<strong>Is that true?</strong>

Going to work day after day, collecting money to buy a house in Beijing then earning to repay a loan is what you want all your life?
Nowadays in all cities, the weather is not good and even harmful for health. Living in this kind of city is not ok. Also seeing so many
years what I will be doing is another problem. Yes, everybody want to live a room that owned by them self.

<strong>Experiencing different kinds of life is amazing.</strong>

English is an international language. It's a tool, for communication. Yesterday I lay on bed and thought if I was good at english(communication)
and also trained for programming whereever I'd like to go I will even live a basic life there.

Don't build a barrier for yourself.
Everyday is a new day.

I read a good saying this morning may you have the same feeling as me.
<blockquote>
Following your heart is the key to a fulfilling life.
