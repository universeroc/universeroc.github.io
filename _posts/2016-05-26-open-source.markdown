I'm reading a [post](http://geek.csdn.net/news/detail/76461) on [CSDN](http://www.csdn.net). Doctor Zhang's experience grasps my eyes, he touched Linux in 1995 and was inspired by Richard Stallman on open source. He had programmed a long time since university, from his heart it's the interests.

Release the code to public is not the final step of open source, it's the beginning. The procedure is the valuable part in his mind. So LVS's first version only cost him a couple of weeks, his released on website. He got helps from people all over the world. One in America wrote the HowTo details, two Googlers developed the IPV6 part of LVS and others helped a lot after LVS accepted by Linux kernal.

I knew Linux since 2006 in my memory during my college. After reading some arctiles, I was passionated about using Linux to work and to study. Especially, after reading Yin wang's [Completely using Linux](https://www.douban.com/note/301736213/). I announced that I was going to install a Linux on my laptop to my roommates. One told me it was a tough way to make it as he did that half year ago. I got the information that he installed a very old version of RedHat which need do a lot commands under shell, need manually to install xwindow. Finally he was tired and had no intersts on using Linux. By searching several hours, I got a new distribution of Linux: Ubuntu, even clearly, it's Ubuntu 7.04. I installed it and maked it as my major OS until graduation.

It's a good start. I learned how to apt-get to install software and to listen music under Linux and also to code with CodeBlocks in C/C++, also touching Python. Open source gives me larger vision of technology and information. At the same, my classmates, they were busy with playing games or trying various anti-virus softwares on Windows, I didn't worry about virus under Linux.

I love open source.
