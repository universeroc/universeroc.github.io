Nowadays I do not write things like I used to do in daily life, instead, let days go day after day.
Today is 15th December 2014, and I event could not remember too much details in last several months, it's all due to the rapid pace in work and life at Beijing. It's clear in my mind that this scene ever happened when I was new to Beijing in 2009, I felt the same rapid pace also on my way to work, however, at that time, I told to myself that I could not be the same as those people: too busy to know what they do, where they go. Now me too.

I have no time to settle down myself to think about what happened today, no time to read or write something in my heart. I'm lost in busy work and I don't know where I want to go as so many people do. Recently I decided to leave this company to become a freelance so that I could have time to think next step. Life is grey sky and foggy without any sunshine with mask everyday, then most part is busy tense work. This is not what I am pursuing for. I'm becoming a cog.

Leave me alone for a short time.

If you want to speed up, firstly you should know how to slow down. Yeah, I agree with this saying. Life is short. Just try to have a more pleasing, more relex, more comfortable, more sunshining time to go. I tell myself also my wife, we should think over what is more import in our life again. Stop repeating yourself. To live a new life from now on as your life is so short and you never have another life again.

Write down little things, little feelings in daily life. Take more photos and travel more places, also have more parties with good friends, laugh more. Life is alive, not live a repeat, old life style.
