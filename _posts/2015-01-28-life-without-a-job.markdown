Without a job means that you lose a stable income. It's the same to me.


No pains, no gains.


Doing your favorite things is a great thing which could make you forget sleep. Life is short and You Only Live Once. So.


Yesterday I watched << Sing My Song >> and their lyric and tune inspired me. It's so real with emotion and you even have full tear in your eyes. And say this is life in deep of your heart.


Friends are you on your road, doing your favorite?
