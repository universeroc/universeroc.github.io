<blockquote>
<p>If software development was really a science, you could apply the scientific method to it. If it was really engineering, then you could apply known engineering techniques. If software development was a matter of producing models, then you could spend your money developing models.</p>
<p>However, it is none of those. <b><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-development-as-a-collaborative-game/">Software development is a "game"</a>, a game of speed and cooperation within your team, in competition against other teams.</b> It is a game against time, and a game for mind-share. You should spend your money to win that game.</p>
<p>Viewing software development as a game gives you better ideas on where to spend your money, how to structure your teams, and how they should allocate their efforts.</p>
