These days I've been working on a project based on web, undoubtedly, I came across a lot of trouble. With one by one being resolved, I wrote some notes to record this procedure. Then I've been thinking whether I should build a blog which I ever built but did not keep it for a long time. So I Google it to find some new ideas to make a personal blog, I got <a href='http://mindhacks.cn/2009/02/15/why-you-should-start-blogging-now/'>mindhacks.cn</a> again, and this time I read both <a href='http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2009/01/overnight-success-takes-long-time.html'>Overnight success takes a long time</a> and <a href='http://blog.codinghorror.com/overnight-success-it-takes-years/'>Overnight Success: It Takes Years</a>. Both are great passages.

Yesterday on bus, I talked with workmate something about work and life. Money is the main part. Whatever we talked about getting a new job or running a startup, money is core, and almost the final target. Meanwhile, nowadays, most people live with a rapid pace, too quick to think, just keep the same with surroundings. And more and more people want a overnight success without so much setbacks, without a long time hard work, just with a random luck.

It reminds me a phrase spoken by Master Wugui "inner peace".
Thanks to the hard journey to the destination, you feel it valuable and impressive. Imagine that you go there by air, you never experience the precodure, you never could enjoy the pure pleasure. Overnight success takes long time. No pains, no gains. I figure out that if you did not overcome difficulties but directly to enjoy the success, you could not know why those people are crying and hugging together, and you could not understand the important, the hard moment completely.

You could not expect overnight success happens. What you must remember success takes years not only by luck or a leap. Keep improvement steadily day by day, year by year, it's arriving. After reading the very passages, I calm down to think over about the project I'm doing and the plan of building a blog. Almost everyday I will find something worthy to make notes, they are texts, emails, dialogs in IM, pages from SNS, images, or daily work. They are tiny things here and there. I need a blog to tidy and think. I'm looking for a good place to settle down, before I found it, here is my camp.

If you found this essay, may it could give some help.
