Happy new year 2017!

Last night, on bed, before sleep, I read my blog old posts, and found that it's been so much time to go.

The first post is 2014-05-08. Now it's been more than two years.

An idea in my mind is to make an application by myself according to my mind. Until now I don't make it. :(

The same as writing blog, doing one thing for a long time, you gain a lot. Even it's a small picec of cake, it costs lots of extra time to finish it. There are many stories to say, for example, as I know, Linux, the famous world wide known OS, Notepad++, a text editor, AdBlock, also developed in extra time, f.lux, a software work cross-platform to controll screen to adjust blue light to protect your eyes, etc.

When you look their websites, you'll find all of them started at enough early time, and last a long time also. So what you should figure out is time make the good result, you can't build roma in one day.

Find one interested thing or feature, make it, and improve it. Try to focus on one thing, and do it, one day, maybe it helps you in some way.

I'm doing one since this post.
