I love Safari's reader mode very much on iOS. It shows me a clean and clear page without any ADs or other resources. I'd like to find a solution of Chrome on Desktop and I find this link [Google is working on a Chrome reading mode, try it out](http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/25/google-chrome-reader-mode/).

[DOM Distiller](https://github.com/chromium/dom-distiller) is Chrome's reader mode.

How to enable reader mode in Chrome ?

append **--enable-dom-distiller** in your shortchut of Chrome on both Desktop and Taskbar

I'm sorry to tell you this feature has not been developed well enough according to Safari's.
It has a long way to go.

I have not tried any extension to make a reader mode, if I found one I will update this essay.
