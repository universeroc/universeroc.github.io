It's the first post of 2015. And I left Tencent at 19th this month. After I posted this message on Weixin, several friends asked me almost the same question: Where to go or what are you going to do? and someone sent me thumb.


These two days I've been choosing whether to accept a chance in a company or continue what I planned to do. It's a small company but with great, healthy finance flow and now they want to have a browser product themselves and I have talked with their leader about technology and product design. Directly saying, it's suitable to me, based on chromium, a new product, a great team, and full support from company resources.


But it's not the same if you treat it as a startup than as a job. To me, to lead a startup is sooner or later. So I leave Tencent without any reliable chance already. I don't think it's a bad thing. Life is a procedure. You should go through hard tough times to figure what is important and how to deal with it. Without this experience, you will get pains from other things.


There is a new way when you don't find any way to go.


Nobody could think instead of you, and you must think over what you are doing or going to do, never be too lazy to use your brain, unless you don't want to be stronger and better.


How time flys! 2014 has gone and 1/12 of 2015 is going to be the past. Don't waste time ever. Do what you badly want to do; try what you love to. Don't be afraid, and don't be regret when you get old.
