Several days ago, I had been watching a video[link](http://www.csdn.net/article/a/2014-04-25/15818584) from CSDN.com about GNOME.Asia. My friend leo sent me a link [GNOME.Asia](http://code.csdn.net/news/2819735). I registered it as quickly as I could.

Show you my ticket:

Later I'll add more details after next weekend. :)
