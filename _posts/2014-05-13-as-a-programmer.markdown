I am a programmer.

Last week I talked about job details both with one of my best friends over QQ voice. I told him about what I had been doing everyday. A programmer, to domestic people, is a kind of job which should be coding in front of computer all the time. Even as I know between my classmates, there're an awful lot of them who think a programmer or so called developer is a great job who owns strong ability could apply to.

Misunderstanding appears. I don't know other programmers' opinion but I has been agreeing with that all jobs are equal. And keep coding probably will do harm to you. I can't believe that you could work all day long on coding and not tired any more.

I saw this essay this morning, it shows me something that I'd like to share with you.

In the past, world did not move fast until IT industry started. Nowadays mobile is so popular beyond most people imagination. If you look around at the bus stop, in the subway, at the table of restaruant, in the meeting, even on the toilet people are using mobile so attentively. There's a saying "The longest distance in the world it's I am sitting with you but you're watching your phone".

Everyday we'll receive information from newspapers or television or raido or mobile phones. We keep us online all the time so as not to miss any useful information. Sometimes I thought whether we became slaves to information? Hurry to do anything. Hurry to wake up, to have breakfast, to get to work, to work, and to get off. Even at home I'll keep my computer working until getting to bed meanwhile my wife was playing games or viewing news.

I didn't think it's a real life, and the style of life should be. Life should be colorful, rich, and with kinds of things to experience not only with PC or phone. And also I told to myself that your life should not only have code, there're certainly so many other things to do. To do other things not related to your work tightly, to listen to a song, to climb a mountain, to wander in the park, to read a book, or anything else. Just enjoy your spare time without work affairs.

To me, also to all of you if you found it same as me. Work is not the target of your life, isn't it?
