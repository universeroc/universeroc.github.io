Ever basketball was is my best favorite sport.

These days I have been watching basketball videos of WuYou on [youku.com](http://youku.com). And I figured out that what's CL, DDS and also MBY's meaning. I did more research on WuYou and got that I was the same age to him. Moreover, he has the same height as me and he could slam while I can't.

CL is a name of his basketball team. It short for China Legend.

He starts playing basketball at 9 years old. From that on, he has been playing for 20 years and nowadays he also keeps playing.

Basketball is an amazing sport. Not only NBA has shown us many skilled and talented players, but also in this game each player should play together, think together and fight to the end if you wanna the last win.

I love it as when I play it with friends I enjoy it. As what WuYou said in video, relax, just do it, enjoy the game, when you do all talking about just, the result is about to be what you want.

I played this game after I watched

    <<Slam Dunk>>

but I chose study before I went to high school and never paid more attention to it. That is not an execuse which explain why you do not well in basketball. It's the fact.

I've been working in Beijing for more than six years after graduation and I have not doing sports for more than years. I know my body is under bad condition but I never do an action to break this state. I have been looking forward to having a sound body but when my classmates leave Beijing one by one so there is nobody could play it with me. I began to keep distance from basketball.

Keep doing a basic thing is hard beyond your imagination without friends.

In my opinion, that's why WuYou started CL team. Even in [his weibo](http://weibo.com/morefree), he said recently that he wanted to retire because of his pain.

Yes, basketball is WuYou's life, and he has been playing it for 20 years. And

    what's your life?

I ask myself.

To many many people in daily life, the most part of them, including me, this is a sharp question.

Although I can find some material or book to read to learn, until now I never find a clear answer to it. I keep thinking, day by day, about what you work for? what's happiness from your standpoint? what life you want to live?

Now I'm pragraming for life and I love programing. But what's worrying is that I am not talented and skilled enougth, I'd like more free time and space to enjoy life and work. Doing sports with long time helps you figure out many things in life. When you reach your limitation of your body, you could really relax and have a good rest. Focus on this thing you are doing now also help you concentrate on your job.

Their passion and emotion shown in video touches my heart.

Find your way out in the world. Just do it. You should ask yourself whether you can do it repeatly for more than 10 even 20 years!?
